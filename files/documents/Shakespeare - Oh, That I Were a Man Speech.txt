Oh, that I
were a man! What, bear her in hand until they come to take
hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered
slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man! I
would eat his heart in the marketplace.
Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly
count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely! Oh, that I
were a man for his sake! Or that I had any friend would be
a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies,
valor into compliment, and men are only turned into
tongue, and trim ones too. He is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with
wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
